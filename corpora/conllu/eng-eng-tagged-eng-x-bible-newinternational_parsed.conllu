# This corpus is an automatically annotated version of data from the Parallel Bible Corpus (Mayer & Cysouw 2014) that has been reduced in scope for the purposes of crosslinguistic research. Metadata from the original PBC file is included in this file for reference, as well as the license information and automatic annotations. The first three characters of the filename corresponds to the ISO 639-3 code for the respective language. This document is in CoNLL-U format following UD conventions, with dependencies transferred from English via the SpaCy parser and based on an IBM2 alignment model. For accessibility, verses are identified with the PBC reference number (sent_id), the book, chapter and verse (ref_id), and English translations of verses (eng_text) taken from the World English Bible (https://worldenglish.bible/), which is in the Public Domain. The final `MISC` field of each line contains possible English glosses (based on the IBM2 model) and English morphological information.
